    "some of the reasons why we need to use python are:\n",
    "- Easy to Learn and Use: Python has a simple language that is easy to read and write, making it accessible for beginners.\n",
    " - Rich Ecosystem of Libraries: Libraries like NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, and Flask extend Python's functionality, making it suitable for various applications.\n",
    "- Great for Prototyping: Due to its simplicity and speed of development, Python is excellent for quickly prototyping ideas.\n",
    "- Automation or scripting : If you find yourself performing a task repeatedly, you could work more efficiently by automating it with Python. Writing code used to build these automated processes is called scripting."
